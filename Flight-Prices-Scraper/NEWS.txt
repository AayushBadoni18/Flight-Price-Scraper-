It is evident that the legacy websites are no longer functional, and as a result, this project is currently affected. However, a newer version is already in development. The updated implementation will rely on APIs from alternative providers, with a complete rewrite of the codebase and the addition of a proper user interface. Further updates will be released incrementally. Thank you for your patience.
